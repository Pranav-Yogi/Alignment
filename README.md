# Alignment
   This Nextflow pipeline automates the GATK Best Practices workflow for preparing aligned sequencing reads for variant calling. It takes pre-processed paired-end FASTQ files as input and executes a series of steps sequentially for each sample. 
   First, reads are aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using BWA-MEM, and the resulting alignment is sorted by coordinate using Samtools. Next, GATK MarkDuplicatesSpark identifies and flags PCR duplicates. The pipeline then builds a BAM index before performing Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR) in two GATK steps (BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR), using known variant sites from **dbSNP and Mills & 1000 Genomes Indels** to improve quality score accuracy. Each step utilizes Singularity containers for reproducibility. The final output consists of analysis-ready BAM files with recalibrated quality scores and their corresponding indexes, saved to the specified **03_Alignment** directory. The script is parameterized for easy configuration of paths and tools.
